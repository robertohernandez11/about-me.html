<h2>About me.</h2>
<p>The youngest, out of my brothers and sisters I was born in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. An island located in the Caribbean. I migrated to New York City, when I was fifteen years old.  Attended John F. Kennedy High School, located in the Bronx, NY. </p>

<p>During high school I played a few sports. Baseball, Basketball, Track & Field and Volleyball.  After I graduated in 2003, I went over seas to play volleyball professionally throughout the Middle East, Europe, Central and South America until 2007 when I returned to New York City to settle and start my own family.</p>
<p>I now have a beautiful family, wife and son. Iâ€™m attending General Assembly and taking coding classes to learn on how to become a front-end web developer.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me and know a little more about what I have done and hopefully I am looking forward to become.</p>
